Question 1:

Design Grade:- B
TA Comments on Design:-
> had defined all 6 isX() function in abstract class and had used inheritance and overriding method to implement correctly.
> good use of whitespace.
> had included brief discription for different parts of the program.

> had made CallExp.value handle immutable env.
> Is not type checking inside value function and was able to answer why its not a good practise.

> lambda function is not taking care of the environment passed to it.
  Need to follow the rule given by the professor in class for evaluating lambda exp value.

> not checking if its boolean before calling asBoolean() inside ifvalue fn. Add exception handling if its not boolean.

> how are you making a copy of environment inside call exp value function?
> is not checking if formal size equal to argument size inside value function.

> please follow the semantics explained by the professor in class for evaluating value functions.

> was able to explain how value function works.
> Good understanding of the submission.


Question 2:

Design Grade:- B
TA Comments on Design:-
> formals size and argument size is not checked inside addInputsToEnvironment.
> what if entry point is not a function? Add an exception handling for this case.
> copy of old environment is not maintained.
